A door behind the table leads into a huge cathedral-like space. There's so many things to look through, but first you head over to the most obvious. An unfinished frame and blueprints for a prototype Coalition cruiser - something to compete with the Federation and Rebellion's own advanced warships. You make scans of the blueprints then set fire to them. This should set the Coalition back a bit, though they probably have copies.","data/events_coalition.xml$/FTL/event[@name=""COALITIONHOLD_CEALAFORMER_4""]/choice/event/choice[1]/event/choice/event/text","","","",""
