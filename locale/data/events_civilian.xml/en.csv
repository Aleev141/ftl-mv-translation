Back during the infamous Mantis - Human war, a time when the seeds of thought that would grow to be the Federation had only just barely been planted, the Human people were in dire straits. The far more dangerous and warrior-like creatures that were the Mantis caused havoc among the unprepared human colonies. The Humans turned to the only allies they had at the time, the Engis, hoping for assistance. The Engis reluctantly accepted, but only in turn if the humans would liberate the slaves from the Mantis war camps. The two forces fought for years and years for control over the neighbouring planet Mars, which the Mantis had managed to secure as a stronghold and key point for planning their invasion. Rather than negotiating for a ceasefire, or surrendering, the human people continued to fight the Mantis to near extinction.

Both the Hive and Elders declared war on the Slugs, and so they fought for several years. Eventually, the Slugs surrendered and offered back territory.
