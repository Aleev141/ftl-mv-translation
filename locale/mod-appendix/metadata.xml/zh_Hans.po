"Faster Than Light that also uses the hard-coded modding API Hyperspace to "
"accomplish things never before possible in FTL mods.\n"

"FTL Multiverse introduces an entirely new storyline, which while similar to "
"FTL's, takes place after the original events of the Federation Civil War. It "
"also introduces dozens of new factions, many of which are based on type B "
"and C variants of player ships from the vanilla game!\n"
"These factions all have their own sectors, ships, crew, and often times "
"special questlines as well where you'll meet some notable characters, even a "
"few you might recognize from vanilla like Slocknog and Kazaaakplethkilik. "
"While far more extensive than the vanilla lore, everything new to MV builds "
"on top of it.\n"
"\n"
"---**全新的挑战与结局**---\n"
"\n"
"-Fight new minibosses bosses along the way for unlocks and special loot "
"items you can't get anywhere else\n"
"-Homeworld sectors are now completely revamped, with their own unique events "
"and encounters, including extra deadly elite enemies similar to the Rebel "
"ships you'll find at fleet controlled beacons\n"
"-Achieve various alternative endings through secret questlines. Your "
"adventure doesn't always have to end with the Flagship!\n"
"\n"
"---**以及更多功能**---\n"
"\n"
"-完全重做过的商店，现在还可触发事件，并且被不同的派系拥有。Different store "
"owners are more likely to sell different things, and some might not be so "
"keen on selling to you at all unless you have something to convince them\n"
"-Sylvan the Traveling Merchant can be found all around the galaxy, selling "
"many items (usually at a discount) as well as providing additional quests in "
"certain sectors. Don't try and provoke him however, as only the strongest "
"and most powerful ships could ever hope to take on his mighty vessel\n"
"-Battle over 800 new enemies, including stations that can't evade shots but "
"have stronger defenses, battleships that can wield up to 6 weapons, "
"motherships that wield massive arrays of drones, and more\n"
"-Use combat augments to disable your enemies's systems, and install internal "
"upgrades to improve your ship in many different ways without using augment "
"slots\n"
"-Upgrade your own crew using the Crew Lab, to specialize them towards "
"certain niches that work better with your playstyles\n"
"-All of this and more awaits you in the completely overhauled experience "
"that Multiverse brings to FTL: Faster Than Light"
