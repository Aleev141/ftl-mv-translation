	<text>It's strange how aggressive the Dynasty is, especially when the break away vagabond Ghosts are much more reclusive. Though, perhaps that may be why they broke away in the first place. But, you'll have to think about this later, as a Dynasty vessel is inbound!</text>	
	<text>Make no mistake, the ship coming at you isn't friendly. A Dynasty vessel lurches forward, eyeing your weapons before attacking!</text>	
	<text>A garbled message comes across your radio. "Weapons. They belong to me. GIVE!" A Dynasty ship uncloaks nearby, weapons drawn!</text>	
	<text>For such an elegant name as the Spectral Dynasty, their ships are uncharacteristically hostile and violent. There's no better example than the vessel here, as it approaches menacingly.</text>	
	<text>A shot flies right past your ship, and seconds later a purple vessel comes drifting out of the clouds. Looks like it's Ghosts... and they don't look friendly!</text>	
	<text>A bloodchilling scream fills your speakers, followed by unsettling static. Any captain with lesser nerves might have fainted on the spot, but you know better. This isn't some demon, this is a much more real threat. A Dynasty vessel approaches!</text>
	<text>Looks like you're receiving a short range broadcast. "Your flesh shall appease the demon's heart one more day. Your weapons shall be its destruction! For the good of the Dynasty!" A Ghost vessel appears nearby, weapons drawn and already firing!</text>
	<text>An unsettling chant echoes through the nebula as a ship approaches. "The demon's heart shall cease! The demon's heart shall cease!", followed by the flashing of gunfire as a Dynasty vessel draws near. Are you the demon? You aren't sure, but you won't have time to ask!</text>
	<text>In light of the seemingly empty nebula, you make conversation with the crew on enemies you could have found here instead. As soon as one of them mentions the Dynasty, a ship comes barreling out of the nebula, as if it were summoned. Speak of the devil...</text>
	<text>At first you assume the static over the radio to be nonsense, but suddenly your translator starts to pick up words! "A breather! In Dynasty space, how putrid. It turns my insides into coils of anger. I will unleash hell on you scum!"</text>

	<text>The Vagabonds usually just avoid Dynasty space, not worth the risk. This ship must be desperate - desperate enough to attack you!</text>
	<text>Looks like you aren't safe from the scrap hungry Vagabonds, even in Dynasty space where they try to so hard to repel them. Prepare for combat.</text>
	<text>You notice a Vagabond ship nearby watching you hungrily. "In my heart I feel the desire of a new vessel... this one is depreciated and has failed its function..." The Ghosts attack!</text>
	<text>A Vagabond, likely fleeing from Dynasty patrols, has stumbled right into you. "You side with the Dynasty, nay? Oh, for what am I asking. The risk is not worth it, I shall simply remove you from my path."</text>

	<text>Usually the Rebel ships you'd expect to see here are Autos, but it's not surprising to see an Engineer here either. Unfortunately, they're no less friendly either!</text>
	<text>"You've just come here to make my damn job harder, haven't you? Piss off!" A particularly agitated Engineer vessel swerves to attack you!</text>
	<text>After a long day working on the always damaged Auto-ships they construct, it's no wonder the Engineers feel the need to let off some steam. Alas, it looks like you're their next target!</text>
	<text>"Oh come on! I haven't even finished my lunch break! You picked the wrong time to ruin my day, asshole!" Hostiles inbound!</text>

	<text>The Dynasty has been waging 'war' against the Auto-ships for a long time now. How the Rebels are able to afford such a massive stream of ships - or why Vance approved it - is a mystery to you, but it's only a hopefully minor inconvenience to you.</text>
	<text>"You are not father. Father is not as ugly as you. Entering combat mode." The nearby Rebel Auto-ship suddenly activates and attacks!</text>
	<text>You assume this to be an empty beacon... until you notice the dozens of dormant Auto-ships floating through the nebulas. You try to avoid them, but unfortunately it looks like one of them has noticed you and attacks!</text>
	<text>You practically bump hulls with a Rebel Auto-ship, but it's too late to slip away before it's already noticed you and started to attack!</text>
	<text>Curse the Rebels and their massive fleet of Auto-ships at constant disposal. Looks like you have another ship to take care of before you can carry on.</text>
	<text>The Dynasty will probably be pleased to hear of your path of destruction through all of the Auto-ships you see. But before you can brag, you have another ship to add to your kill count.</text>

	<text>The Dynasty normally doesn't take prisoners, but it seems they haven't gotten the desired reaction from the unidentified ship behind them, as you can hear the agitation in the shouting Ghost captain's voice. As soon as you enter the system however, his concentration focuses on you!</text>

	<text>The Ghosts might not be paranormal, but they sure do put you on edge. You jump when a Vagabond ship comes drifting out of the nebula. Man the stations!</text>	
	<text>You always find yourself second guessing when you encounter a wreck. You don't have to think about it for very long because the wreck at this beacon moves in to attack you first.</text>	
	<text>The Vagabonds usually get their ships by stealing them from their victims, but if they encounter an already abandoned ship they'll happily inhabit it. Whichever way they inherited this ship doesn't matter, because it's hostile and moves in to attack.</text>	
	<text>The wreck at this beacon is no idle ship forgotten amongst the clouds. It's teeming with Ghosts ready to steal your ship.</text>	
	<text>You've prepared for and experienced all kinds of situations in the Federation, but nothing startles you as much as the Ghost-populated vagabond wrecks that are always oozing out from these clouds.</text>	
	<text>Your ship receives a hail, but you aren't sure from where. You accept, and a painfully loud static floods the speakers, insulting your bloodline and calling you a 'filthy lung-borne breather'. A Ghost ship approaches, weapons ready!</text>	
	<text>"I've heard it told our repugnant odor originates from a mixture of mercaptans. Fascinating is it not? Ah, but what truly fascinates me is how you fell for this most clever distraction!"</text>	
	<text>The Vagabond Ghosts are typically aggressive. A life of anarchy after having abandoned your war-driven native faction does something to a person. Nevertheless, they're a target for you to destroy!</text>

			<text>The Ghost Hunter hails you. "That. Was. LEGENDARY! Do you know how rich we're gonna be? Wait, yes yes. Your payment. Considering the bounty from this will be enough for us to buy an entire moon, maybe even a small planet, I suppose it doesn't hurt to give you something extra-special. We have a new cruiser that we've been working on, and I couldn't think of anyone else more worthy of piloting it than you."</text>
