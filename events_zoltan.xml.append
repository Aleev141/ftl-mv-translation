			<text>"I'm afraid that's a lie. One of many. As you can see, we are not Zoltan in the same sense that you know. Long long before the Federation, all of us Zoltan looked this way. Back then, we were steaming ahead full force into the interstellar era, driven to be the first of many competing nations. But this competition turned to travesty, and nuclear holocaust became imminent. Osmia was annihilated, and the survivors were forced to flee the planet. For almost centuries Osmia was out of our reach, a solemn reminder of our failure."</text>

					<text>"The lost explorers roamed the surrounding nebula, unable to settle for long without devolving into war once again. However, in those mysterious clouds they found something. At the center of the infamous Great Eye nebula was a monolith that held immense, god-like power. The Zoltan came to worship it, and so it brought them unity. This gave birth to the Illesctrian faith and the Ministry who sought to uphold this new peace. The Ministry, however, was brutal with its enforcement, and to justify its cruelty the leadership constructed an ever-large and rapidly expanding codex of laws no man nor army could ever memorize. Through force they assimilated every last Zoltan colony."</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>But what happened? Why are the Zoltan hard-light now?</text>
						<event>
							<text>"Yes, see, the Great Eye also brought with it the discovery of other, similar tech. Aether, a highly conductive and resistant metal alloy used to forge the ruins around the Eye could be used to create sustainable hard-light generators. This tech enticed the Ministry's top scientists, who saw it as a solution for the Osmia crisis alongside various other tech. Though Aether was used to construct most of Zoltan kind's most infamous technology like our special shields, we also used it to create new part-organic part-mechanical forms to explore Osmia with. This was a success and the explorers were revered as heroes, and many flocked back to recolonize the planet. The current Minister at the time only lived for a little longer until he succumbed to a natural death and was replaced by the new Minister, Lumei."</text>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>Wait, but wasn't this centuries ago? How is Lumei still in charge?</text>
								<event>
									<text>"This was indeed long ago, but we'll get to the answer for your question soon enough. Under Lumei's leadership the codex was almost doubled in size and enforcement became even stricter. The Osmian explorers, still held high in reverency by the public, were given seats in the Ministry so Lumei could keep them close to him as pawns. Because of the connection between Aether and the Great Eye, these hard-light forms took on a religious significance as well, and so Lumei himself underwent transformation to secure his power. As the technology became better researched soon the wealthy elite, priests, and eventually even the common people were able to afford such procedures. Supremacy of the tranformants took hold and, fearful that this divide might create a split between the Zoltan, the Ministry began to normalize and enforce transformancy."</text>
									<choice hidden="true">
										<text>Continue...</text>
										<event>
											<text>"Most adamant non-transformants died of natural causes and the newer more 'progressive' mindset took hold. All Zoltan over the age of 7 were to be immediately transitioned into hard-light chassis. The only place the Ministry struggled to touch was, ironically, Osmia itself. A group of non-transformants had taken hold there, seizing control of the territory between the wastelands that had survived the initial holocaust. Eventually the Ministry gave up and spent their effort erasing the importance of Osmia from the rest of the Zoltan - something made easier by the recent discovery of other sapient life. And so, that is how the first of we Osmians came to be. The Ministry wants nothing more than for the galaxy to forget we exist and for us to die out naturally."</text>

They were captured by the Ministry and kept locked away in a secret laboratory under 'protocol 3,' in the case of an unforeseen cataclysmic failure of the hard-light forms. We estimate there's likely several hundred of them locked away from centuries ago - each of them an innocent life, as well as a time capsule for ancient forgotten history.

					<text>"You think the Federation didn't know about us? I'm sure they've briefed all the rest that we're some dangerous threat. That way, if we ever tried to start another civil war, the Federation wouldn't hesitate to side with the Ministry. But that's besides the point. I shouldn't be so grim. We didn't save everyone. We couldn't have. But we still saved dozens of our people, and we may finally recover some of our lost history. But as the leader of my people I have failed to prepare us for such outcomes. I cannot return to Osmia. I humbly request that you accept my services, captain."</text>
